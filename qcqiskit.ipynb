    "## Classical Computing vs. Quantum Computing\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum computing works in a different way than the classical computing that we're used to. A classical computer is what you are viewing this on right now, and includes things like laptops, pcs, smartphones, and tablets. Quantum computers are a lot more rare, and are typically kept in strictly monitored environments that prevent physical disturbance of the computer. Although classical computers are more popular, quantum computers have a much higher processing power. And even though they are both computers, they way they operate is fundamentally different. Below highlights the differences in how these computers work:  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Classical Computers\n",
    "* Store data in bits\n",
    "* Operations are based on Boolean algebra\n",
    "* Circuits are modeled from classical physics\n",
    "* Bits can only be in two states: 0 or 1\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quantum Computers\n",
    "* Store data in qubits\n",
    "* Operations are based on linear algebra\n",
    "* Circuits are modeled from quantum mechanics\n",
    "* There is an infinite amount of qubit states\n"
